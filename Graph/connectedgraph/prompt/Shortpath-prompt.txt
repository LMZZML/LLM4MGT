In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (3, 4) (3, 5) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 0)
Q: Is this graph connected?
A: The nodes are split into different connected components, so the answer is no.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (3, 5) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (2, 3)
Q: Is this graph connected?
A: There is a path between every pair of nodes, so the answer is yes.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
