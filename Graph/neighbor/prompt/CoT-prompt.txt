In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 8, and the edges are: (0,1) (1,3) (3,4) (4,5) (5,7) (7,6) (6,2) (2,8) (8,0)
Q: Is (2,6) directly in the edges list??
A: Let’s check all edges: (0,1), (1,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,7), (7,6), (6,2), (2,8), (8,0). After checking, we find that there is an edge (2,6), so the answer is yes.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0,1) (1,2) (2,3) (3,4) (4,5) (5,6) (6,7)
Q: Is (0,4) directly in the edges list?
A: Let’s check all edges: (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7). After checking, we find that there is no direct edge (0,4), so the answer is no.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, and the edges are: (0,1) (1,2) (2,3) (4,5) (5,6)
Q: Is (4,5) directly in the edges list?
A: Let’s check all edges: (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6). After checking, we find that there is an edge (4,5), so the answer is yes.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,1) (1,2) (3,4) (4,5)
Q: Is (2,3) directly in the edges list??
A: Let’s check all edges: (0,1), (1,2), (3,4), (4,5). After checking, we find that there is no direct edge (2,3), so the answer is no.
