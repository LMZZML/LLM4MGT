In a tree rooted at node 0, (i, j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, and the edges are: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6).
The depth of a tree is defined as the maximum length of a path from the root node to any leaf node, where the depth of the root node 0 is considered 0.
Q: What is the depth of this tree?
A: The depth of this tree is 2.

In a tree rooted at node 0, (i, j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7).
The depth of a tree is defined as the maximum length of a path from the root node to any leaf node, where the depth of the root node 0 is considered 0.
Q: What is the depth of this tree?
A: The depth of this tree is 3.

In a tree rooted at node 0, (i, j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
