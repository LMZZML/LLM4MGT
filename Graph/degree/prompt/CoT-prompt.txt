In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 8, and the edges are: (0,1) (1,3) (3,4) (4,5) (5,7) (7,6) (6,2) (2,8) (8,0)
Q: What is the degree of node 2?
A: Let’s check all edges:
(0,1) — not connected to node 2.
(1,3) — not connected to node 2.
(3,4) — not connected to node 2.
(4,5) — not connected to node 2.
(5,7) — not connected to node 2.
(7,6) — not connected to node 2.
(6,2) — connected to node 2.
(2,8) — connected to node 2.
(8,0) — not connected to node 2.
After checking all edges, we find that node 2 has edges (2,6) and (2,8), so the degree of node 2 is 2.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, and the edges are: (0,1) (1,2) (2,3) (4,5) (5,6)
Q: What is the degree of node 5?
A: Let’s check all edges:
(0,1) — not connected to node 5.
(1,2) — not connected to node 5.
(2,3) — not connected to node 5.
(4,5) — connected to node 5.
(5,6) — connected to node 5.
After checking all edges, we find that node 5 has edges (5,4) and (5,6), so the degree of node 5 is 2.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0,1) (1,2) (2,3) (3,4) (4,5) (5,6) (6,7)
Q: What is the degree of node 0?
A: Let’s check all edges:
(0,1) — connected to node 0.
(1,2) — not connected to node 0.
(2,3) — not connected to node 0.
(3,4) — not connected to node 0.
(4,5) — not connected to node 0.
(5,6) — not connected to node 0.
(6,7) — not connected to node 0.
After checking all edges, we find that node 0 has edge (0,1), so the degree of node 0 is 1.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,1) (1,2) (3,4) (4,5)
Q: What is the degree of node 3?
A: Let’s check all edges:
(0,1) — not connected to node 3.
(1,2) — not connected to node 3.
(3,4) — connected to node 3.
(4,5) — not connected to node 3.
After checking all edges, we find that node 3 has edge (3,4), so the degree of node 3 is 1.
