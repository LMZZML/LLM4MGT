In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 8, and the edges are: (0,1) (1,3) (3,4) (4,5) (5,7) (7,6) (6,2) (2,8) (8,0)
Q: Is there a path between node 2 and node 7?
A: Node 2 is connected to node 6 through the edge (6,2), and node 6 is connected to node 7 through the edge (7,6), so the answer is yes.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, and the edges are: (0,1) (1,2) (2,3) (4,5) (5,6)
Q: Is there a path between node 3 and node 6?
A: Node 3 belongs to the connected component {0, 1, 2, 3}, and node 6 belongs to the connected component {4, 5, 6}, so the answer is no.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0,1) (1,2) (2,3) (3,4) (4,5) (5,6) (6,7)
Q: Is there a path between node 0 and node 5?
A: Node 0 is connected to node 1 through the edge (0,1), and continuing through the edges, node 1 is connected to node 2, node 2 to node 3, node 3 to node 4, and node 4 to node 5, so the answer is yes.

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,1) (1,2) (3,4) (4,5)
Q: Is there a path between node 2 and node 4?
A: Node 2 belongs to the connected component {0, 1, 2}, and node 4 belongs to the connected component {3, 4, 5}, so the answer is no.
