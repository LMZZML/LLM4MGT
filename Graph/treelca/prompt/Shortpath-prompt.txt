In a tree rooted at node 0, (i, j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, and the edges are: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6).
Q: What is the lowest common ancestor of node 3 and node 4?
A: The lowest common ancestor of node 3 and node 4 is node 1.

In a tree rooted at node 0, (i, j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7).
Q: What is the lowest common ancestor of node 6 and node 7?
A: The lowest common ancestor of node 6 and node 7 is node 5.

In a tree rooted at node 0, (i, j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (0, 1) (1, 2) (2, 3) (3, 4).
Q: What is the lowest common ancestor of node 2 and node 4?
A: The lowest common ancestor of node 2 and node 4 is node 2.

In a tree rooted at node 0, (i, j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 8, and the edges are: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (2, 7) (7, 8).
Q: What is the lowest common ancestor of node 6 and node 7?
A: The lowest common ancestor of node 5 and node 6 is node 0.
